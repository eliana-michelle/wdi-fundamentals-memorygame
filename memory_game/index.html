      <h2>Why Play?</h2>
        <p>Why play a memory game? Well, let's face it, you probably are sitting in bed at 3 PM on a Wednesday watching bad reality tv and wondering how your life came to this. In other words, why not? You aren't doing anything! Besides, memory games are good for you. I mean, I'm no doctor, but I read that on the Internet so it must be true, right?</p>
